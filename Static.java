class Student{  
     int rollno;  
     String name;  
     String college="ITS";  
}  
Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.

Java static property is shared to all objects.
Example of static variable
//Java Program to demonstrate the use of static variable  
class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  
   //method to display the values  
   void display (){System.out.println(rollno+" "+name+" "+college);}  
}  
//Test class to show the values of objects  
public class TestStaticVariable1{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
 Student s1 = new Student(111,"Karan");  
 Student s2 = new Student(222,"Aryan");  
 //we can change the college of all objects by the single line of code  
 //Student.college="BBDIT";  
 s1.display();  
 s2.display();  
 }  
}
